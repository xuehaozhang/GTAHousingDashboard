This project explores the housing market in the city, focusing on the affordability and availability of properties for sale. Utilizing Python, I web scraped 7,212 sales listings from realtor.ca, amassing a robust dataset for analysis.

I created a comprehensive analytical dashboard to illustrate the insights obtained from the data. The dashboard was constructed using Tableau. 

Through this project, I aim to bridge the informational gap in Toronto's housing market, rendering a clearer perspective for potential buyers and policymakers.
