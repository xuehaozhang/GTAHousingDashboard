This project explores the housing market in the city, focusing on the affordability and availability of properties for sale and for rent. Utilizing Python, I web scraped 6,636 rent listings and 7,212 sales listings from realtor.ca, amassing a robust dataset for analysis.

I created a comprehensive analytical dashboard to illustrate the insights obtained from the data. The dashboard was constructed using two different tools, Tableau and PowerBI, to showcase the same narrative on Toronto's housing market landscape. The dual-tool approach caters to different user preferences and demonstrates versatility in presenting data-driven insights.

Through this project, I aim to bridge the informational gap in Toronto's housing market, rendering a clearer perspective for potential buyers, renters, and policymakers.
